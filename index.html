      Modern Family</a></h1>
  </h1>
    <p> Modern Family is an American family sitcom television series created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan for the American Broadcasting Company. It ran for 11 seasons, from September 23, 2009, to April 8, 2020. It follows the lives of three diverse family set-ups in suburban Los Angeles, linked by patriarch Jay Pritchett.</p>
    <h2 style = "color:bisque;background-color:black">Premise</h2>
    <p>Modern Family revolves around three different types of families (nuclear, blended, and same-sex) living in the Los Angeles area,
       who are interrelated through Jay Pritchett and his children, daughter Claire and son Mitchell. 
       Patriarch Jay remarried a much younger woman, Gloria Delgado Pritchett (n√©e Ramirez), a passionate Colombian immigrant[5]
        with whom he has a young son, Fulgencio Joseph "Joe" Pritchett, and a son from Gloria's previous marriage,[6] Manuel "Manny" Delgado. 
        Jay's ex-wife DeDe and Gloria's ex-husband Javier both make occasional appearances in the show.</p>
      <p>Jay's daughter Claire was a homemaker, but has returned to the business world. She is now the chief executive of her father's business, Pritchett's Closets and Blinds. She is married to Phil Dunphy, a realtor and a self-professed "cool dad", who is an amateur magician, as well. They have three children: Haley, a stereotypically ditzy teenaged girl;[7] Alex, an intelligent and nerdy middle child;[8] and Luke, the offbeat only son.[9] Haley's off again, on again boyfriend Dylan is a permanent fixture in the show.
        Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his husband Cameron Tucker have one adopted daughter, Lily Tucker-Pritchett, of Vietnamese origin. At the series finale, they adopt another child, a baby boy named Rexford. As the name suggests, this family represents a modern-day family, and episodes are comically based on situations that many families encounter in real life.</p>
